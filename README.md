# Sales-Management-System
The application was written in Java Swing technology with a database connection.
<ul>
<li>The application has an entry form to the application, i.e. login and password.</li>
<li>It has a method that generates a random login and password after creating a new account.</li>
<li>We add the product sold by the company to the database and then we can display the products in the form of a JTable.</li>
<li>The application also has buttons to go to specific bookmarks and the ID of the person who is logged in in the lower left corner.</li>
<li>The application has validation of all fields and validation of duplicates in the SQL database</li>
<li>Unfortunately, I was unable to create a ScrollPane for the table, so I will have to fix it in the future.</li>
<li>The database which the application is connected is my local one on the computer, which I also intend to change in the future so that everyone can see in full how the application works.</li>
</ul>
